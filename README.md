SIR (Susceptible/Infected/Recovered) simulations include a release "shelter-in-place" (voluntary quarantine) end date after 60 days. Cases will peak again. Model assumes life returns to _almost_ normal where people are more careful, but moving around more. Number of daily human contacts is based on a poisson distribution.
